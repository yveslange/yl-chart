= Ideas =
- Rename multipleVertical to vertical
- Create a function to get the correct effect ?
- Ticks should be in axis sub-object key
  point:
    axis:
      x:
        label: "blaba"
        tickSize: "full"
      y:
        label: "blabla"
        tickSize: "full"
- Position of label should be configured ?
- Position of label depends on text size, padding. Make it auto ?



= Check =
- If the module works without any points effect
